 * The command is deliberately thin. Everything that decides anything lives in
 * `lib/sync/plan.js`, everything that reads the world lives in
 * `lib/sync/gather.js`, and everything that writes lives in
 * `lib/sync/apply.js`. What is left here is policy — the flags and the
 * questions — which is exactly the part that differs between `sync`, `push`,
 * `pull` and `status`. The report is the part that must not differ between
 * them, so it lives in `cli/report.js`, which all four import.
 *
 * **Prompts re-plan; they never patch.** When the planner cannot decide
 * something on its own it says so in `pending` and emits no action for it. This
 * asks the author, then calls `plan()` a second time with the answers in
 * `policy.resolved`. Nothing is fetched again, so the second pass is free, and
 * it keeps the planner a pure function of its inputs rather than something that
 * blocks on a terminal halfway through. It also means an answer is applied to
 * the same course it was asked about.
