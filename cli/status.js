/**
 * Status: `sync`, up to the point where it would write.
 *
 * The same steps `cli/sync.js` takes — gather, plan, report — over the same
 * engine, with one policy nothing can change:
 *
 *     { write: { canvas: false, local: false }, conflict: 'newest',
 *       adopt: null }
 *
 * Neither side is written. Both flags off is what makes this a preview of
 * `sync` rather than of push or pull: no direction is pinned, so the planner
 * decides each item the way a plain `sync` would, and every write it may not
 * make lands in `withheld`, which the report prints under "Left alone".
 *
 * `buildReport` does the rest. Handed no `applied` list it renders the plan as
 * a preview rather than as a record of what ran, which is the same shape
 * `--dry-run` gets. One consequence worth knowing: under a policy that writes
 * to neither side every action is withheld, so nothing ever reaches "Would
 * apply" and the writes a real sync would make are read off "Left alone", one
 * line per side.
 *
 * ## mtime is gone as a change signal
 *
 * Old status called a file modified when its mtime was later than `last_sync`.
 * A `git clone` stamps every file with the checkout time, so a fresh clone
 * reported the entire course as modified — a report that cries wolf on every
 * file is a report nobody reads. The planner compares each side against the
 * fingerprint the last sync recorded for it instead, so a clone reports
 * nothing and an edited file reports itself.
 *
 * Old `--remote` had the same trouble one layer up: it rebuilt a set of Canvas
 * ids by hand and called anything missing from it "CANVAS-ONLY", which was
 * systematically wrong for pages, whose local id is the numeric `page_id` while
 * the module item exposes only the slug. Matching the two sides is the
 * planner's job and it does it against a base.
 *
 * ## There is no offline status any more
 *
 * "What would a sync do" cannot be answered without knowing what Canvas holds,
 * so the flag that used to gate the Canvas read has nothing left to gate and is
 * gone. Both ways of not reaching Canvas — no `CANVAS_COURSE_ID`, or a course
 * that will not answer — end the run with an error that says why the command
 * needs it, rather than with a partial report built from half the facts.
 *
 * ## What the exit code means
 *
 * Zero for a course mid-edit, whatever is waiting in it: both sides holding
 * work is the normal state, and a report that fails the run for being
 * interesting is one nobody can put in a script. Non-zero for the two things
 * that are not that. One is status not answering at all — no course id, a
 * course it cannot read, a `-m` naming nothing. The other is a course a `sync`
 * would refuse rather than work through: a collision, or two Canvas modules
 * deriving one folder name. Neither clears by syncing, both need a person, and
 * a refusal fails the run everywhere else in this tool — `sync --dry-run` over
 * either course exits non-zero too.
 *
 * @param {object} options - Commander's flags, plus three injection points for
 *   tests that commander never sets: `courseDir`, `syncFile` and `gitDirty`. A
 *   test needs its own tree, its own state file, and a git answer that does not
 *   depend on the checkout it runs in.
