/**
 * Pull: `sync` with the direction pinned the other way from push.
 *
 * The same four steps `cli/sync.js` takes — gather, plan, apply, report — over
 * the same engine, with one policy nothing can change:
 *
 *     { write: { canvas: false, local: true }, conflict: 'canvas',
 *       adopt: 'canvas' }
 *
 * The working tree is written and Canvas is not. A file that changed on both
 * sides takes the Canvas version. A Canvas object already sitting there under
 * the same type and title is claimed by the local file that matches it rather
 * than written out a second time beside it. None of that is lost when the
 * policy forbids a write: the planner records it in `withheld`, and the report
 * names it.
 *
 * Everything that decides anything lives in `lib/sync/plan.js`, everything that
 * reads the world in `lib/sync/gather.js`, everything that writes in
 * `lib/sync/apply.js`. What is left here is the part that is genuinely pull's:
 * the `--force` confirmation and the `--prune-local` one, both of which run
 * **over the plan or over the working tree**, so neither needs a network.
 *
 * ## The mtime guard is gone, and `--force` means something else
 *
 * Old pull refused to write any file it could not prove was its own output,
 * judged by comparing the file's mtime against `last_sync` — a guess from the
 * shape of the file, which read "cannot tell" as "leave it alone" and so
 * skipped every file on a tree that had never synced. The planner asks the real
 * question instead: it compares each side against the fingerprint the last sync
 * recorded for it, so a file Canvas has not touched is not written, and one it
 * has is written without anybody having to guess.
 *
 * What is still load-bearing is git. `guardDirty` in the planner refuses to
 * write over — or delete — any file `git status` reports as modified or
 * untracked, because git is the only copy of whatever is in it. And
 * `gitDirtyPaths` answers `available: false` outside a git checkout or wherever
 * git cannot be run, at which point `gatherLocal` marks **every** file dirty and
 * a pull writes nothing at all. `--force` is the one lever that switches that
 * guard off, for overwrites and deletes alike. It is dangerous exactly in
 * proportion to how much work git has no copy of, so it asks first.
 *
 * ## A Canvas rename no longer renames the file
 *
 * Old pull derived the local filename from the Canvas title on every run, and
 * renamed the file when the title changed. The local path is the key of a sync
 * row now, so the title lands in the file's frontmatter and the filename stays
 * as the author left it. The numeric prefix still moves: that is the local
 * order, and a Canvas-side reorder is a `reorder-local-module`.
 *
 * ## Writing a Canvas object into the tree moved out
 *
 * `writeCategoryFile`, `downloadReferencedFiles` and `createPullFileResolver`
 * live in `lib/sync/local-write.js`, where the engine that calls them can reach
 * them without requiring a command. Nothing left in this file writes a Canvas
 * object out; what is left decides whether the run may.
