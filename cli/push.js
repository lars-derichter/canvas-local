/**
 * Push: `sync` with the direction pinned.
 *
 * The same four steps `cli/sync.js` takes — gather, plan, apply, report — over
 * the same engine, with one policy nothing can change:
 *
 *     { write: { canvas: true, local: false }, conflict: 'local',
 *       adopt: 'local' }
 *
 * Canvas is written and the working tree is not. A file that moved on both
 * sides is pushed rather than pulled. A Canvas object already sitting there
 * under the same type and title is claimed by the local file rather than
 * duplicated. None of that is lost when the policy forbids a write: the planner
 * records it in `withheld`, and the report names it.
 *
 * Everything that decides anything lives in `lib/sync/plan.js`, everything that
 * reads the world in `lib/sync/gather.js`, everything that writes in
 * `lib/sync/apply.js`. What is left here is the part that is genuinely push's:
 * the first-push confirmation, the warning that an assignment update moves
 * grades already in the gradebook, and the `--prune-canvas` confirmation. Each
 * of those runs **between plan and apply, over the plan**, which is what makes
 * them answerable without a network.
 *
 * A Canvas-only reorder is deliberately left alone. `policy.order` bites only
 * when both sides moved; when only Canvas moved the planner gives it to Canvas,
 * which under push is a local write, so it is withheld and reported. Old push
 * imposed the local order on every run because it rebuilt every item list, and
 * that silently reverted anyone who reordered a module in the Canvas UI.
 * Settling a contested order is `sync`'s job, so push takes no `--order` flag.
 *
 * What this tool sends Canvas per type is no longer here: the three content
 * strategies, `buildFileResolver`, `pushQuiz`, `pushExternalTool` and
 * `refuseQuizBackedDelete` live in `lib/sync/canvas-write.js`, where the engine
 * that calls them can reach them without requiring a command. Two warnings left
 * for the same reason: `sync` writes assignments and deletes Canvas objects
 * too, and has to say the same words about both, so the grade check lives in
 * `cli/grade-impact.js` and the prune listing in `cli/prune-warning.js`. What is
 * left here is the question itself, which is push's own.
